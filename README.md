1. How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first thinking about what I want the program to do and breaking it down into smaller parts. For my project, I planned out the 3D scene by deciding which objects I wanted, where they should be placed, and how textures and lighting would work.
Working on this project helped me learn new design skills like thinking visually, planning object layouts, and considering how lighting affects the scene. My design process involved testing small parts first, like adding a single object or light, and then combining
everything into the full scene. These tactics, like planning first and testing in steps, can be used in future projects to stay organized and make sure everything works well together.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by starting simple and adding more features step by step. While working on my 3D scene, I used new development strategies like applying textures, adding lights, and adjusting object placement carefully. Iteration was really important.
I would try something, see how it looked, and make changes if it didnâ€™t work. My approach to developing code changed as I went through the milestones; at first, I just wanted the code to run so I could have  somewhat of a base of what I wanted, but later, I planned, tested
small pieces, and fixed problems along the way. These strategies helped me complete the project successfully.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me reach my goals by teaching me how to solve problems and create programs. Learning computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge and skills that I can use in both school and future jobs. For example, I now know how to work with
textures, lighting, and 3D objects, which can help me in classes with simulations or projects that need visuals. Professionally, these skills could be used in embedded systems or game development, where designing efficient programs and visual outputs is important.
By practicing and improving these skills, I will be better prepared for future educational and career opportunities.
